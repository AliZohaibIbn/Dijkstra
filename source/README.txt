This project is an open-source visualization tool for Dijkstra's Algorithm, designed to serve as an educational resource and a practical demonstration of pathfinding techniques. 
By leveraging SDL2 to create an interactive and visually engaging experience, the project enables users to experiment with grid-based pathfinding by placing obstacles, setting 
start and target points, and observing the algorithm in action. Open to contributions and modifications, the tool encourages collaborative learning and further development by the 
community. Anyone integrating or enhancing this project is kindly requested to credit the original authors to acknowledge their efforts and maintain the spirit of open collaboration.
