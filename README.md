# Dijkstra Path Finding C++
Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualized With SDL2 in C++.

This project is an open source visualization tool using SDL2 for visualizing Dijkstra's Algorithm. A start node is placed at 1, 1 block and you can add the end node via right mouse click and 
obstacles one by one each block via the left moouse and to activate the algorithm, we will use the enter (return) key and the start node will then look for the end node with the shortest path.
Anyone integrating or enhancing this project is kindly requested to credit the original authors to acknowledge their efforts and maintain the spirit of open collaboration.
